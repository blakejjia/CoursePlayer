# Enhanced Progress Saving System

## Overview

This document explains the improved JSON file writing and progress saving system for your course player app. The new system addresses the issue of when to save playback progress to ensure users don't lose their place when the app is paused, backgrounded, or terminated.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multiple Save Triggers

The progress is now saved in the following scenarios:

- **Manual Pause**: When user explicitly pauses playback
- **App Lifecycle Changes**: When app goes to background, becomes inactive, or is terminated
- **Periodic Saves**: Every 10 seconds during active playback (to prevent data loss)
- **Seeking**: When user manually seeks to a different position
- **Explicit Save**: Manual save button available in UI

### 2. Throttled Progress Saving

To avoid excessive file writes, progress saving is throttled:

- During playback: Only saves every 5+ seconds
- Periodic timer: Saves every 10 seconds if playing
- Immediate saves: For user actions (pause, seek, app lifecycle changes)

### 3. App Lifecycle Integration

The system uses Flutter's `WidgetsBindingObserver` to listen for:

- `AppLifecycleState.paused` - App going to background
- `AppLifecycleState.detached` - App being terminated
- `AppLifecycleState.inactive` - App interrupted (phone calls, etc.)
- `AppLifecycleState.hidden` - App hidden by system
- `AppLifecycleState.resumed` - App returning to foreground

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

1. **`core/audio/providers/audio_player_provider.dart`**

   - Added app lifecycle observer
   - Implemented periodic progress saving timer
   - Enhanced progress saving logic
   - Added manual save method

2. **`core/services/app_lifecycle_service.dart`** (New)

   - Dedicated service for handling app lifecycle changes
   - Ensures progress is saved when app state changes

3. **`features/audioPage/widgets/progress_save_button.dart`** (New)

   - UI widget for manual progress saving
   - Shows confirmation when progress is saved

4. **`main.dart`**
   - Initializes the app lifecycle service

### Key Methods

#### `_saveCurrentProgress()`

- Core method that saves both song progress and album's last played song
- Includes error handling and debug logging
- Called by all save triggers

#### `_startProgressSaveTimer()` / `_stopProgressSaveTimer()`

- Manages periodic saving during playback
- Timer automatically stops when app is backgrounded
- Restarts when app returns to foreground

#### `saveProgress()`

- Public method for manual progress saving
- Can be called from UI components
- Useful for explicit save actions

## Usage Examples

### Manual Save Button

```dart
// Add to your audio page UI
import 'package:lemon/features/audioPage/widgets/progress_save_button.dart';

// In your widget tree:
const ProgressSaveButton()
```

### Programmatic Save

```dart
// Save progress from anywhere in your app
final audioNotifier = ref.read(audioPlayerProvider.notifier);
await audioNotifier.saveProgress();
```

## Configuration

### Timing Settings

- **Progress Save Interval**: 10 seconds (configurable via `_progressSaveInterval`)
- **Throttle Threshold**: 5 seconds between automatic saves during playback
- **Manual Actions**: Always save immediately (pause, seek, app lifecycle)

### Debug Logging

The system includes comprehensive debug logging:

```
Progress saved: 42s for song 123
App lifecycle state changed: AppLifecycleState.paused
App going to background - saving progress
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Loss Prevention**: Progress is saved even if app is killed unexpectedly
2. **Performance Optimized**: Throttling prevents excessive file writes
3. **User-Friendly**: Manual save option gives users control
4. **Robust**: Handles various app states and interruptions
5. **Debugging**: Clear logging helps troubleshoot issues

## Future Enhancements

Consider these additional improvements:

1. **Batch Operations**: Group multiple updates for better performance
2. **Offline Queue**: Queue saves when device is offline
3. **Cloud Sync**: Sync progress across devices
4. **Recovery**: Auto-recovery from corrupted JSON files
5. **Settings**: User-configurable save intervals

## Testing

To test the new system:

1. **Play audio** - Progress should save every 10 seconds
2. **Background app** - Progress should save immediately
3. **Force quit app** - Progress should be preserved on restart
4. **Seek position** - Progress should save at new position
5. **Use save button** - Manual save should work with confirmation

The enhanced system ensures your users never lose their place in courses, providing a much better user experience for long-form audio content.
